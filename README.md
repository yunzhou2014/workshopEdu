===========
A fully responsive educational website template developed using Kraken (An express-based Node.js web application bootstrapping module) with Dust.js Less CSS3 and JQuery. It's purely front-end by now. I also utilized the grid system in Bootstrap3 and other major components such as carousel, modal for video and gallery, navbar.
